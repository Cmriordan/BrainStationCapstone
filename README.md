# BrainStationCapstone
Capstone Project - Audio Classification with NN
This is my capstone project that I completed for BrainStations Data Science bootcamp.
The data used is the UrbanSound8K dataset, which can be downloaded from the UrbanSound website. The authors of this dataset specify how to train a model by using
a 10fold cross validation. I have not done this. This project is not for any academic paper, or to be used as a comparison. 

Audio EDA - This goes over pre-processing audio files and feature extraction. A visual of the mono waves, spectrograms, MFCC's and a audio sample are displayed.

Models - First a simple random forest is made, and then an iterative process for a simple feed forward neural network.
